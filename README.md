# Hapi.js REST API Boilerplate

A boilerplate application with initial 100% code coverage.

## Motivation
Let's face it: Express is commonwealth library of Node community, yet it provides only thin layer of your application.
I personally used several frameworks before/after Node libraries, sometimes configuration over convention thing kills me.
If you have deadlines, whereas finding a good path in Node, Hapi is great.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo.
2. Do `npm install` in order to fetch packages from *npm*.
3. Make your database configuration from database middleware.
4. Fire da' tests `npm test`.
5. Assuming you gotta passed tests, `npm start`.

## Stack
I tried to use packages of Hapi community as much as I could in order to enhance consistency.
